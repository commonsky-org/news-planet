Tens of thousands of Afghan allies will all but certainly be left behind.::Though the streets are quiet, Kabul residents describe a struggle to make ends meet in a reeling economy where banks and government offices are closed, and uncertainty reigns.::Representatives Seth Moulton and Peter Meijer said they could not get answers on the evacuation from the Biden administration, so they went to Afghanistan to see for themselves.::::Biden administration officials said the trip by Representatives Seth Moulton and Peter Meijer had wasted resources needed to help evacuate people in Afghanistan.::\u201cWe don\u2019t want our forces, God forbid, to harm or harass women,\u201d a Taliban spokesman said.::The American withdrawal coincided with a threat by the Taliban to stop Afghans from traveling to the airport, an ominous sign that the window may be slamming shut for thousands of people desperate to leave.::The Pentagon has increased the number of flights, but questions remain about whether the military can sustain the pace as the deadline to end the operation draws near.::The meetings are the highest-level in-person talks between a Biden administration official and Afghanistan\u2019s new leadership.::Tens of thousands are still hoping for rescue, with priority recently being given to Americans over Afghan allies, according to a U.S. official and those involved in the effort.::After almost two decades as a guerilla movement, the Taliban have completely underestimated what it means to run a state. It will be extremely difficult for them to keep Afghanistan under control.::German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has been under fire since the fall of Kabul. In a DER SPIEGEL interview, he speaks about the mistakes that have been made and the dangers of the rescue operation currently under way in Afghanistan.::In early July, I met with a leading Taliban military commander. I asked when his fighters would arrive in Kabul. His answer: \"They are already there.\" How the Afghanistan mission failed and what happens next.::German diplomats only found out by chance that their American counterparts were evacuating from Kabul and they were blindsided by the Taliban's rapid advance in the capital. But internal documents show that Berlin ignored urgent warnings.::Thousands of local hires who worked for the German armed forces are desperately trying to make their way to the Bundeswehr's evacuation flights. But Germany's bureaucracy is making it difficult for them and the Taliban is blocking the way to the airport.::The Taliban claim they will be a just and more gentle power this time around, but all past experience justifies the panic and horror. What is the country facing under its new rulers?::China and Russia agreed to strengthen communication and coordination on the Afghan issue as President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin exchanged in-depth views on the situation in the war-torn country in a phone conversation on Wednesday.::U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that the United States would work to ensure Americans and Afghan partners could leave Afghanistan beyond Aug. 31, the planned deadline for the ongoing evacuation led by the U.S. military.::Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Dutch Foreign Minister Sigrid Kaag exchanged their views on the situation in Afghanistan as well as bilateral ties in a telephone conversation on Tuesday.::The European Union (EU) will increase its humanitarian aid to Afghan people to over 200 million euros (236 million U.S. dollars), announced European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday.::A Chinese envoy on Tuesday highlighted that military forces of the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia must be held accountable for their violations of human rights in Afghanistan, and the related UN resolution must cover this issue.::<p>US, UK and Australia urge citizens and visa holders to stay away from airport unless otherwise instructed amid rush to evacuate</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/aug/26/afghanistan-live-news-updates-evacuation-refugees-taliban-kabul-airport-latest\">Afghanistan \u2013 latest updates</a></li></ul><p>The United States has warned crowds trying to access Kabul airport to leave the area, as Britain and Australia cited the \u201chigh threat\u201d of a terrorist attack.</p><p>All three countries asked that people no longer attempt to travel to the airport, a distressing call as people with practically no other means of escape from Afghanistan attempt to save their lives and those of loved ones.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/26/afghanistan-us-uk-australia-security-threat-kabul-airport-evacuations\">Continue reading...</a>::<p>Faced with crowd stampedes and Taliban reprisals, even those eligible for travel to UK have begun to give up hope</p><p>For the past four days, Nangyalai, a 42-year-old minicab driver from south London, has been queueing with his wife and 11-month-old baby outside the Baron hotel on the edge of Kabul airport, trying to get close enough to the entrance gate to show guards his British passport.</p><p>There is a sign by the gate stating \u201cBritish passport holders only\u201d.
