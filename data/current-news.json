The staff wear medical masks, the cinemas have been sanitised and the guests mass at the door like anxious family members outside a maternity ward. Happily they are in good hands; Pedro Almod\u00f3var is the midwife. He delivers an opening night picture that is positively ringing with life.</p><p>Showcasing a sure-footed performance from Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Parallel Mothers shapes up as a boisterous swapped-at-birth melodrama, full of mix-ups and moral quandaries, occasionally tilting towards farce. But first appearances are deceptive and the film belies its high-concept conceit. All newborns, we\u2019re told, carry the ghosts of the past in their genes \u2013 and so it is with Almod\u00f3var\u2019s latest, which is knotted and subversive; an autopsy of dark Spanish history dressed up as a bright baby shower. It\u2019s a turbulent movie. The ingredients don\u2019t always gel. But it is so generous of spirit that it would be churlish to complain. Most directors give so little. Almod\u00f3var, by contrast, offers an over-abundance of riches.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/01/parallel-mothers-review-pedro-almodovar-penelope-cruz-venice-film-festival\">Continue reading...</a>",

For her generation, you did not show your passport to anyone \u2013 let alone have it photographed\u2019</p><p>One day when I was around 11, I had to take a day off school. I had asthma and felt rotten, but I also felt ashamed about not being well. Mum decided to take me out to cheer me up. She took me to an auction \u2013 it wasn\u2019t anything special, just one of those local things that would be advertised in the papers back in the day. She was hoping we might find a bike, probably just to stop me crying because everyone else had one and I felt left out.</p><p>We took a bus to the Royal Horticultural Halls in Westminster and arrived late. Almost everything had gone. There were no bikes left. I was despondent. Mum was gunning for anything to cheer this moany kid up when a Kodak Instamatic went up for sale. I wasn\u2019t convinced, but she persuaded me we should get it. By the time we\u2019d got back home, it was an obsession \u2013 the best toy I\u2019d ever received. <br /><br />I didn\u2019t even take pictures at first. Mum said she wasn\u2019t going to buy me any more film, so I was terrified of wasting the few shots I had<em>. </em>But the camera lens became my way to frame and visualise the world. I built a baby darkroom in a cupboard and started printing from the age of 12.
