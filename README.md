# ðŸŒŽ Planet News
This is a small experiment to visualize the current news (from open news sites without paywalls) on a rotating globe.

Visit the app here: ðŸŒŽ [Planet news](https://news.ianua.app).

<a href="https://news.ianua.app" target="_blank"><img src="./screen.png" /></a>

The news is refreshed every 6 hours.

If you have an idea or suggestion for the app, then create an issue here in the repo, or reach out directly at ðŸ«± [ianua.app](https://ianua.app).
