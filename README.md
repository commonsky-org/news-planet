# ðŸŒŽ News Planet
This is a small experiment to visualize the current news (from open news sites without paywalls) on a rotating globe. It is extremely hacky (started during Covid lockdowns), but is stable and is refreshed every 6 hours.

Visit the app here: ðŸŒŽ [News Planet](https://news.ianua.app).
