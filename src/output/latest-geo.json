Today, an equally meaningful slogan might be that \u201cthe technological is political\u201d, to reflect the way that a small number of global corporations have acquired political clout within liberal democracies. If anyone doubted that, then the recent appearance of Elon Musk alongside Donald Trump&nbsp;at a rally in Pennsylvania provided useful confirmation of how technology has moved centre-stage in American politics. Musk may be a manchild with a bad tweeting habit, but he also owns the company that is providing internet connectivity to Ukrainian troops on the battlefield; and his rocket has been chosen by Nasa to be the vehicle to land the next Americans on the moon.There was a time when the tech industry wasn\u2019t much interested in politics. It didn\u2019t need to be because politics at the time wasn\u2019t interested in it. Accordingly, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple grew to their gargantuan proportions in a remarkably permissive political environment. When democratic governments were not being dazzled by the technology, they were asleep at the wheel; and antitrust regulators had been captured by the legalistic doctrine peddled by Robert Bork and his enablers in the University of Chicago Law School \u2013 the doctrine that there was little wrong with corporate dominance unless it was harming consumers. The test for harm was price-gouging, and since Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s services were \u201cfree\u201d, where was the harm, exactly? And though Amazon\u2019s products weren\u2019t free, the company was ruthlessly undercutting competitors\u2019 prices and pandering to customers\u2019 need for next-day delivery.

They are recounting 1,000 years of death in the city: how many are \u00adburied in the labyrinth of tunnels that make up Les Catacombes, what killed them and how the diseases that may have led to their demise have \u00addeveloped over the centuries.In the first ever scientific study of the site, a team of archeologists, anthropologists, biologists and \u00addoctors is examining some of the skeletons of an estimated 5-6 \u00admillion people whose bones were literally dumped down quarry shafts at the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th. Continue reading...::Demonstrators gathered across France on Saturday\u00a0to show their support for mass rape victim Gis\u00e8le Pelicot whose ongoing trial saw her ex-husband as well as some 50 defendants \u2013 aged from 26 to 74 \u2013 take the stand.

The French capital has undergone\u00a0extensive transformations in recent years to become a bike-friendly city under Mayor Anne Hidalgo, whose cyclist-favouring policies have drawn resentment from motorists.::A day after French President Emmanuel Macron accused ministers, journalists and commentators for distorting remarks he made on Israel being created by the UN, he faced accusations of trying to squash reporting to a mere reproduction of the presidential palace's press releases.::France's decision to grant visas to Russian deserters is being celebrated by human rights groups who hope other EU countries will follow suit, offering a way out for Russian soldiers who want to stop fighting in Ukraine.::Under the terms of the deal, the holding company of luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault, France's richest man, would take a controlling stake in the Ligue 2 club Paris FC, according to a source close to the matter who asked not to be named.::The newly formed French government plans to adopt another, tougher immigration bill next year, and leading the charge is hardline Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau. It is the latest in a series of moves under French President Emmanuel Macron to tackle immigration, a favourite talking point of the far right.::Paris prosecutors have opened a murder probe after a motorist driving an SUV ran over and killed a cyclist following a dispute in central Paris. Tense standoffs between cyclists and drivers have become increasingly common as the heavily congested capital strives to become one of Europe's most bikeable cities.::As part of a broader city-wide transformation, the surroundings of the historic Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris will be transformed into an ecological oasis \u2013 with 1,800 square metres of green space and a bouquet of new trees.

The finance bill, which includes major tax hikes and spending cuts, is set for debate in parliament next week.::It's time to take a look at time. In this edition of Entre Nous, we look at a few of the specifically French traditions in regard to \"le temps\", or time. Be it the nightly news (\"le 20h\"), or France's many time zones, or a few of the many expressions in French, we find out all about French time.::French far-right leader Marine Le Pen strongly denied committing any wrongdoing at a Paris court hearing on Monday as she and her National Rally party stand trial over the suspected embezzlement of European Parliament funds in a case that could put her long-held presidential ambitions in jeopardy.::Politicians from across the political spectrum are up in arms over healthcare giant Sanofi's plans to sell France's best-known medical drug Doliprane to US investors, a move critics say would lead to a \"loss of sovereignty\" for the country in a sensitive industry.::Paris\u2019s slate-grey zinc rooftops are a key part of the French capital\u2019s visual identity. They have long inspired painters and filmmakers and only exist thanks to the expertise of the roofers who install and maintain the galvanised metal covering many of Paris\u2019s buildings. Their expertise could soon be included in UNESCO's intangible heritage list, as the profession adapts to the challenges of global warming.::French President Emmanuel Macron is reportedly feeling increasingly frustrated with his new right-wing government, and has confided in people close to him that he feels ashamed of some of the more hardline ministers that have been appointed. After failing to secure an absolute majority for his centre-right party in this summer's snap elections, Macron has had to stand back on domestic issues after entering a power-sharing arrangement with more conservative forces.::Gregory Villemin was just four years old when he was tragically murdered on a fall day in 1984.

Their accounts shed light on the widespread ignorance of drug-facilitated abuse that allowed the victim\u2019s ordeal to go undetected for years.::A vote of no-confidence aiming to bring down the nascent government of French Prime Minister Michel Barnier failed on Tuesday after the far-right National Rally party refused to back the motion. The motion was brought forward by the left-wing New Popular Front, who won the most seats in the snap legislative elections called by President Emmanuel Macron earlier this year.::France\u2019s new government, led by conservative Prime Minister Michel Barnier, will have to lean on the support of the far right as it faces a no-confidence vote in parliament on Tuesday.

Armand aims to bring the public deficit down to five percent of GDP next year, with a longer-term goal of reducing it below the EU's three percent limit by 2029.::French photographer Janine Ni\u00e9pce was one of the country\u2019s first female photojournalists.
